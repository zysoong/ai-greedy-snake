# AI Greedy Snake (ongoing)
Experimental project: Snake game AI using reinforcement learning (ongoing, not functional status)\
The agent runs purely with the console, which makes it extremely easy to be trained with a cloud server

# Current state
DDQN model with reduced state dimensions reached a average score of 12
