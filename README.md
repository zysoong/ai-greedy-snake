# AI Greedy Snake (ongoing)
Experimental project: Snake game AI using reinforcement learning (ongoing, not functional status)\
The agent runs purely with the console, which makes it extremely easy to be trained with a cloud server\
Current status: configuring NFQ model\
The agent managed itself to loop in the purpose of avoiding hitting the walls, which is not an optimal convergence but still shows that the NFQ model is working.\
