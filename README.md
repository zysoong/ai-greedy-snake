# AI Greedy Snake (ongoing)
Experimental project: Snake game AI using reinforcement learning (ongoing, not functional status)\
The agent runs purely with console, which makes it extremely easy to be trained with a cloud server\
Current status: configuring NFQ model\
The agent managed itself to rotate forever in a purpose of avoiding hitting the walls, which is not a optimal convergence buts still shows that the NFQ model is working.\
Planned improvement: Use epsilong Greedy and try to adapt the model and its parameters\

# Plan
Explore NFQ model(testing)\
Explore Actor-Critic model (ongoing, coding)\
Explore DQN model (ongoing, coding)\
Explore Actor-Critic-Target model (ongoing, coding)
